# Traffic Accident Analysis - Colab 2025

## Project Overview
This project provides comprehensive analysis of traffic accident data using Python and data visualization techniques. The analysis includes statistical insights, pattern identification, and interactive visualizations to understand traffic incident trends and contributing factors.

## Features
- Statistical analysis of traffic accident patterns
- Data visualization using matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly
- Interactive charts and graphs
- Trend analysis over time
- Geographical mapping of incidents
- Factor correlation analysis

## Files
- `Untitled8.ipynb` - Main Jupyter notebook containing all analysis code
- `README.md` - This documentation file

## How to Run

### Option 1: Google Colab (Recommended)
1. Open the `Untitled8.ipynb` file in this repository
2. Click "Open in Colab" button at the top of the notebook
3. Run all cells sequentially (Runtime â†’ Run all)
4. Upload your traffic accident dataset when prompted

### Option 2: Local Jupyter Environment
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Raith18/Traffic-Accident-Analysis-Colab-2025.git
   cd Traffic-Accident-Analysis-Colab-2025
   ```
2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn plotly jupyter
   ```
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Untitled8.ipynb
   ```
4. Run all cells in order

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- plotly
- jupyter/google colab

## Data
The notebook is designed to work with traffic accident datasets in CSV format. Ensure your dataset includes columns for:
- Date/time of incident
- Location information
- Accident severity
- Contributing factors
- Weather conditions (if available)

## Results
The analysis provides insights into:
- Most common accident types and causes
- Time-based patterns (hourly, daily, seasonal)
- Geographic hotspots
- Correlation between various factors
- Predictive patterns for accident prevention
